## **R-Statistics-Learning**  

This repository contains my journey of learning R for statistical analysis. I will be updating this repository daily with new scripts, datasets, and insights.  

### **Project Overview**  
- Learning R for statistical analysis and data visualization.  
- Exploring different R packages for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling.  
- Documenting key concepts and practical implementations.  

### **Folder Structure**  
```
R-Statistics-Learning/
│-- scripts/            # R scripts for different topics  
│-- datasets/           # Sample datasets used for analysis  
│-- notebooks/          # Jupyter Notebook files (if applicable)  
│-- README.md           # Project documentation  
```

### **Installation & Setup**  
To run the scripts, you need to install R and RStudio. You may also need the following R packages:  
```r
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "tidyr", "readr"))
```

### **Daily Updates**  
I will be pushing updates daily with new scripts and learning notes.  

### **Usage**  
Feel free to explore the scripts and modify them for your own learning. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
